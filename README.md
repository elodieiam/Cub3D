# Cub3D Project 🕹️
Cub3D is a **dual project** that involves **creating a 3D game** using **raycasting techniques** to render a 2D map as a 3D environment. 

This project enhances our understanding of **game development**, **graphics programming**, and **real-time rendering**.

The project helps improve our skills in graphical programming, mathematical computations, and algorithm optimization.

By creating this game, we gain a deeper understanding of 3D graphics and efficient rendering in C.

## Features 📋
1. **Raycasting:** Implement a raycasting algorithm to render a 3D environment from a 2D map.
2. **Interactive Controls:** Provide user controls for movement and interaction within the 3D world.
3. **Texture Mapping:** Apply textures to walls and other surfaces for a realistic look.

## Objectives 🎯
1. Improve skills in graphical programming with C.
2. Master mathematical computations for 3D rendering.
3. Enhance understanding of optimization techniques for real-time graphics.

## Screenshot 🖼️
We start by parsing a map that looks like this:

And here's an example of the 3D environment generated by the program after parsing the map:
